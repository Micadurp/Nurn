Initially used for a school project where we created a game from the ground up, such as engine and networking, using C++, Lua, and openGL. The code for that project can be found [Here](https://github.com/Manspear/Project_Erebus). Seperated network code from that project as I want to keep it and develop it in order to improve my skills within networking and C++.

*Fun fact:*  
Nurn is an abbreviation and it stands for "Not Using RakNet" as initally in the project we had thought about using RakNet but instead made our own implementation.
